# London Cycling rates

My first streamlit app to display a tile grid map of cycling rates in London. Check it out [here](https://liloho-london-cycling-rates-app-kgvppz.streamlit.app/).

Data can be filtered by frequency and reason of cycling. Visual can be customised in terms of colours and title. Map made with matplotlib.
